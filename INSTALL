In order to install Arturo from source run:

    make install

By default ano is installed into `/usr/local'. You can change this by setting
PREFIX or DESTDIR variables.

    * DESTDIR changes file system root (`/' by default)
    * PREFIX sets installation prefix (`/usr/local` by default).

Examples:

    * make install DESTDIR=~/ano
    * make install PREFIX=/usr
