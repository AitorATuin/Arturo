# ino TODO list:

- Make 'ino build' sensitive to changes all kinds of changes to arguments, so
  that whenever, for instance, '--cppflags' changes, the code is
  _automatically_ recompiled with the new options (rather than having to
  manually invoke 'ino clean' as currently)
- For completeness, add --arflags and --objcopyflags in build.py
  * Also create similar flags for all modules, so every program used by ino can
    be specified (e.g. for 'ino serial')
