{"name":"Arturo","tagline":"Fork of amperka/ino to continue development.","body":"![Arturo Logo](docs/ArturoLogo.png)\r\n\r\n## Introducing Arturo\r\n\r\n> A command-line tool for Arduino\r\n\r\nThis is a fork from [ino/master](https://github.com/amperka/ino/commit/f23ee5cb14edc30ec087d3eab7b301736da42362).\r\nThe original ino contributors did a fantastic job but they decided they no longer\r\nhad time to maintain this tool. I asked them if they wanted me to take over ino\r\nbut they preferred that I fork it. And so Arturo was born.\r\n\r\nStay tuned for more details and changes. I do plan on going through the existing\r\nino PRs and issues to see if there's anything I can fix.\r\n\r\nI am looking for other contributors as well. I especially need Windows and Linux\r\ntesters as I'm doing all this work on a mac.\r\n\r\n## Installing Arturo\r\n\r\nClone this repo, cd Arturo, make install.\r\n\r\nRemember that the Arturo command is ```ano```. It should not conflict in any way\r\nwith ino and you can install the two side-by-side (please file any issues if this\r\nis not true).\r\n\r\nMake sure you do an ```ano clean``` if you had previously built using ino. I will\r\ntry to handle this automatically in a future release.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"docs/Toscanini.png\" alt=\"Arturo Toscanini\" height=\"150\" width=\"147\"/>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
