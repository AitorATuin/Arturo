{"name":"Arturo","tagline":"Fork of amperka/ino to continue development.","body":"![Arturo Logo](docs/ArturoLogo.png)\r\n\r\n## Introducing Arturo\r\n\r\n> A command-line tool for Arduino\r\n\r\nThis is a fork from [ino/master](https://github.com/amperka/ino/commit/f23ee5cb14edc30ec087d3eab7b301736da42362).\r\nThe original ino contributors did a fantastic job but they decided they no longer\r\nhad time to maintain this tool. I asked them if they wanted me to take over ino\r\nbut they preferred that I fork it. And so Arturo was born.\r\n\r\n## Unfortunately Arturo currently only works with version 1.6.1 and earlier of the Arduino SDK\r\n\r\nI am working on a fix but it's a major rewrite to support 1.6.2 and newer toolchains. You can follow along or help contribute on the [feature/ide_1_6_2 branch](https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo/tree/feature/ide_1_6_2).\r\n\r\n## Installing Arturo\r\n\r\nClone this repo, cd Arturo, ```make install``` (on linux you might need to do ```sudo make install```).\r\n\r\nRemember that the Arturo command is ano. It should not conflict in any way with ino and you can install the two side-by-side (please file any issues if this is not true).\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\nSee [the Arturo wiki](https://github.com/scottdarch/Arturo/wiki/FAQ) for Arturo FAQs.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"docs/Toscanini.png\" alt=\"Arturo Toscanini\" height=\"150\" width=\"147\"/>\r\n","google":"UA-62166304-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
