        ## Introducing Arturo
        
        > A command-line tool for Arduino
        
        This is a fork from [ino/master](https://github.com/amperka/ino/commit/f23ee5cb14edc30ec087d3eab7b301736da42362).
        The original ino contributors did a fantastic job but they decided they no longer
        had time to maintain this tool. I asked them if they wanted me to take over ino
        but they preferred that I fork it. And so Arturo was born.
        
        Stay tuned for more details and changes. I do plan on going through the existing
        ino PRs and issues to see if there's anything I can fix.
        
        I am looking for other contributors as well. I especially need Windows and Linux
        testers as I'm doing all this work on a mac.
        
        ## Installing Arturo
        
        Clone this repo, cd Arturo, make install.
        
        Remember that the Arturo command is ```ano```. It should not conflict in any way
        with ino and you can install the two side-by-side (please file any issues if this
        is not true).
        
        Make sure you do an ```ano clean``` if you had previously built using ino. I will
        try to handle this automatically in a future release.
